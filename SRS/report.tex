\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of the SRS}
This Hotel Management System Software Requirement Specification's (SRS) main objective is to provide a base for the foundation of the project. It gives a comprehensive view of how the system is supposed to work and what is to be expected by the end users. Client’s expectation and requirements are analyzed to produce specific unambiguous functional and non-functional requirements, so they can be used by us with clear understanding to build a system as per end user needs.

\section{Abstract}
“Hotel Management System” is a project which is developed to provide an easy and simple way for guests to communicate with the hotel administration and for the administration to manage front office capabilities such as booking reservations, guest check-in/check-out, room assignment, managing room rates, and billing to name a few. We aim to deliver a software platform that will replace time-intensive, paper and spreadsheet-heavy processes. It will also integrate other onsite services that impact the guest's complete experience, such as food and beverage operations, housekeeping and maintenance management, sales and catering, spa management.

\section{Why use InnLogix?}
Simplify reservations, improve operating efficiency and maximize revenue. 
Reduce dependency on manpower. Manual errors become a thing of the past as critical operations get automated and managed in real-time. The staff work in sync with all departments. Assign room cleaning tasks to housekeeping and track it in real-time from the frontdesk or housekeeping console. Overall it is an innovative and easy to use front desk interface that acts as a single-point dashboard to control all your operations. You can customize it to suit your hotel’s needs and manage multiple tasks at all times
